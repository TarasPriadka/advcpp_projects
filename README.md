# Advanced C++ Projects

## Labs Overview:
### Lab 0: Encryption
 - Decryption algorithm for integer encoded files. Used C++ concepts such as: pair, vector.
### Lab 1: Huffman Coding
 - Use relative character frequencies to encode strings. The lab uses Huffman style coding in order to encode and decode string messages from and to binary.
 - Skills applied: Bit Operations, PriorityQueue and Polymorphism
### Lab 2: Containers and Regular Expressions
 - Implement barcode reader(Barcode Code 39) which converts barcode "wide" and "short" lines into 
 - Build recursive XML file reader in order using regular expressions to populate hashtable with low collision count
 - Process a CSV file containing Carts with barcodes by performing lookup of the hashtable 
### Lab 3: Threading
 - Built on top of Lab 2
 - Use the existing cart reading logic with threads
 - Implemented Thread Pool design pattern where the pool object processes CSV file using multiple open threads
 - Improved the speed of processing by 10x with the use of multiple threads
### Lab 4: GUI Programming
 - Using the FLTK library, write a GUI based application that plots a Linear Regression

#### Skills applied across all labs:
 - Preemptive code design with UML in order to specify the requirements for each lab.
 - Using Object Oriented Design techniques, design classes to manage the data and functions
 - Extensive use of C++ stl library with containers such as priority queue, and vectors together with algorithms for sorting and search
